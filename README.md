# Image_Reproduction_Project
This is a group project from 2023 that recreates images using a dataset of other smaller images.
Currently a dataset of Yu-Gi-Oh card art is being used to recreate an input image. The average CIELAB color of each image in the dataset is used to find the best matching image for a specific cell in the image you want to recreate.
Output images are evaluated using Mean squared error, structural similarity index measure and S-CIELAB.
